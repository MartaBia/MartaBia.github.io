title: CloudBnB
date: 2023-01-20
description: CloudBnB is an AirBnB clone, developed by six students at Makers Academy as a one-week engineering project. In this web app, it is possible to sign up and log in. Once logged in it is possible to see the list of all the spaces available for rent. You can also find a space that is available on the dates you want to travel and open a single web page for every space you are interested in. In case you have a space you want to rent, you can add it to the website, so that it will be listed among the other users' spaces.
