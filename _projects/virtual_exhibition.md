description: A Toy Virtual Exhibition website powered by the V&A API. This project was a fun opportunity for me to dive into the world of the V&A Museum and create a captivating website that showcases a collection of fascinating toys. The primary goal of this project was to explore and leverage the V&A API, utilizing its vast collection of data to curate an immersive virtual exhibition. With a passion for both technology and the arts, I wanted to create a website that not only celebrates the beauty and historical significance of toys but also serves as a testament to the power of digital platforms in bringing cultural experiences to life.
